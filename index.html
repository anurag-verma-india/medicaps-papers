        <p>
            Most of these papers are from a Google Drive link that was on the
            Medicaps University's official website (but I can't find it after
            the redesign) All the Mid-Semester Test's question papers are from
            the generous seniors who sent these when me or one of my friends
            asked them before some MST.
